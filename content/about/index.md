# Maciej Åšlusarz

Currently keen on embedded software development (Embedded Linux and/or bare metal on MCU (ESP32 is my favourite)). FPGA & hardware description language enthusiast. 

Done something with fullstack development in the past - especially using CRUD frameworks such as Spring/ASP.NET, libraries like Vue/React or Next.js (which is frontend and backend combined).

Amateur UI/UX designer. Automotive fan, especially the 90s/00s models with some exceptions ([Range Rover Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_Rover_Classic) <3). Unconventional ways of brewing coffee lover such as AeroPress or drip V60.
Actually pursuing BSc degree in Automatics & Robotics.
